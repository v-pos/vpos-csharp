This C# Package helps you easily interact with the vPos API
Allowing merchants apps/services to request a payment from a client through his/her mobile phone number.

The service currently works for solutions listed below:

 - EMIS GPO (Multicaixa Express)

Want to know more about how we are empowering merchants in Angola? See our [website](https://vpos.ao)

## Features
- Simple interface
- Uniform plain old objects are returned by all official libraries, so you don't have
to serialize/deserialize the JSON returned by our API.

## Documentation
Does interacting directly with our API service sound better to you? 
See our documentation on [developer.vpos.ao](https://developer.vpos.ao)

## Configuration
This C# library requires you set up the following environment variables on your machine before
interacting with the API using this library:

| Variable | Description | Required |
